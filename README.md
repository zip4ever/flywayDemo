# flywayDemo
This project contains a demo of the Flyway usage.

It both demonstrates the proper Flyway commands, as well as the integration with Spring.

This code is open souce and can be freely used or distibuted. If this example is used in a commercial context (such as a book), please refer to Kevin De Man as the original author of the example.

Note that the master branch is a starting point, a simple Hello world example. The several branches build on this sample to integrate flyway, wire up with Spring and have a call back implemented.
